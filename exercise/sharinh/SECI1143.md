[# Course Information: Probability and Statistical Data Analysis](image.md)

## Course Description
This course provides an introduction to probability theory and statistical data analysis. Students will learn fundamental concepts and techniques used in analyzing data, making statistical inferences, and understanding probabilistic models. The course covers topics such as probability distributions, statistical measures, hypothesis testing, regression analysis, and more. Practical examples and hands-on exercises will be used to reinforce the concepts learned.
