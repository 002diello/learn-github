Professional Document Formatting:

Use a consistent and easily readable font, such as Arial or Calibri.
Maintain a clear and consistent text size (e.g., 12-point font for the main body text).
Apply appropriate line spacing (usually 1.5 or double spacing for readability).
Use headers and subheadings to organize content.
Create a visually appealing layout with margins and proper alignment.
Consistently use bold, italics, or underline for emphasis, but avoid overuse.
Ensure proper page numbering and document headers/footers.
Meaningful Icons:

Icons should complement your content and convey relevant information. They should not be used arbitrarily.
Icons can be found in various icon libraries, both free and paid. Some popular sources include FontAwesome, Iconfinder, and Flaticon.
Choose icons that are clear and universally understood. For example, a magnifying glass icon for search or a trash can icon for delete.
Consider color and style consistency when using icons. They should align with your document's overall design.
Be cautious not to overcrowd your content with icons. Less is often more.
