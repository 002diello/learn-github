# Function: Follow
The "Follow" function in GitHub allows you to keep track of the activities of other users on the platform. When you follow another user, you'll receive notifications about their public activity, such as when they create or contribute to repositories, open or close issues, or comment on pull requests.

To follow a user on GitHub, follow these steps:

1. Go to the profile page of the user you want to follow.

2. Click on the "Follow" button on the top right-hand corner of their profile.

3. If you're not already signed in to your GitHub account, you'll be prompted to sign in.

4. Once you've signed in, the "Follow" button will change to "Following," indicating that you've successfully followed the user.

5. To unfollow the user, simply click on the "Following" button again.

By following other users on GitHub, you can stay up-to-date on their activities, learn from their contributions, and collaborate more effectively. You can also use the "Watch" function to keep track of specific repositories, and the "Star" function to bookmark repositories that you find interesting or useful.
