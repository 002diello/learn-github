# How to commit in Github and Github desktop?
To commit code changes in GitHub, you can use either the GitHub web interface or the GitHub Desktop application. Here are the general steps to commit changes using both methods:

### Using GitHub web interface:

2. Click on the "Code" button and copy the repository URL.
3. Open your local repository and make the changes you want to commit.
4. Stage the changes you want to commit by using the command "git add <filename>" or using the staging area in your code editor.
5. Commit the changes with a descriptive commit message using the command "git commit -m 'commit message'".
6. Push the changes to the remote repository using the command "git push" or by clicking on the "Push" button in the GitHub web interface.

### Using GitHub Desktop:

1. Open the GitHub Desktop application and select the repository where you want to commit changes.
2. Make the changes you want to commit in your local repository.
3. Stage the changes you want to commit by clicking on the "Changes" tab in the GitHub Desktop application and selecting the files you want to stage.
4. Write a descriptive commit message in the "Summary" field.
5. Click on the "Commit to main" button to commit the changes to the main branch.
6. Click on the "Push origin" button to push the changes to the remote repository.

In both methods, it is recommended to follow the best practices for committing code changes, such as writing descriptive commit messages and committing frequently.
