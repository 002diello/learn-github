# GitHub
GitHub is a web-based platform for software development that uses Git for version control. It allows developers to collaborate on projects, share code, and manage their software development workflows.

GitHub provides a range of features that make it easy for developers to work together on projects. Some of the key features of GitHub include:

1. **Repositories**: GitHub provides a hosting service for Git repositories, making it easy to manage and share code with others. Repositories can be public or private, and can be accessed by anyone with the appropriate permissions.

2. **Pull requests**: GitHub's pull request feature allows developers to review and discuss code changes before they are merged into the main codebase. This can help ensure that code changes are of high quality and don't introduce bugs or conflicts.

3. **Issues**: GitHub's issue tracking system allows developers to create and track bugs, feature requests, and other issues related to a project. Issues can be assigned to specific developers, labeled, and prioritized to help manage the development process.

4. **Collaboration**: GitHub provides a range of tools to help developers collaborate on projects, including commenting on code, reviewing pull requests, and collaborating on code changes using branches and forks.

5. **Integrations**: GitHub integrates with a range of other software development tools and services, such as CI/CD pipelines, code analysis tools, and project management tools.

GitHub is used by millions of developers and organizations around the world for software development. It is particularly popular among open source software projects, which use GitHub to collaborate on code and manage contributions from a community of developers.

## GitHub Cheat-Sheet
A GitHub cheat sheet is a reference guide that provides a quick overview of the most commonly used commands and features in GitHub. It can be a handy resource for developers who are new to GitHub or who want a quick reference to the most important commands and features.Some common items that might be included in a GitHub cheat sheet include:

1. [**Git commands**](https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf): Many GitHub cheat sheets include a list of basic Git commands, such as git add, git commit, git push, and git pull. These commands are used to manage version control in GitHub repositories.

2. [**GitHub commands**](https://training.github.com/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet/): The cheat sheet might also include a list of basic GitHub commands, such as git clone, git fork, and git merge. These commands are used to collaborate on GitHub projects and manage issues and pull requests.

3. [**Markdown syntax**](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/): GitHub uses a flavor of Markdown for formatting text in issues, pull requests, and README files. A cheat sheet might include a list of basic Markdown syntax, such as how to create headers, links, and lists.

4. [**Keyboard shortcuts**](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-github/keyboard-shortcuts): GitHub has a number of keyboard shortcuts that can help speed up your workflow. A cheat sheet might include a list of common shortcuts, such as how to navigate between tabs, search for code, and create new files.

- [Github: commit](./github-commit.md)
- [Github: webhosting](https://github.com/drshahizan/learn-github/blob/main/github-webhosting.md)

There are various remote repository hosting sites:

- [GitHub](https://github.com/)
- [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/product)
- [Gitlab](https://about.gitlab.com/)

Follow the workflow at [https://github.com/join](https://github.com/join) to set up a free account, username, and password. After that, [these steps](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/create-a-repo) will help you create a brand new repository on GitHub.

  
This can be useful for keeping your local workspace up to date.

Merge conflicts are not uncommon when working in a team of developers, or on Open Source Software. Fortunately, GitHub has some good documentation on how to handle them when they happen:

- [https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-pull-request-merges](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/incorporating-changes-from-a-pull-request/about-pull-request-merges)
- [https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-merge-conflicts](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-merge-conflicts)
- [https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/resolving-a-merge-conflict-using-the-command-line](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/resolving-a-merge-conflict-using-the-command-line)
  
You can also use [git rebase branchname](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Rebasing) to change the base of the current branch to be branchname

The git rebase command is a lot more powerful. Check out [this link](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History) for more information.
