To be eligible for the GitHub Student Developer Pack, students must be at least 13 years old and enrolled in a degree-granting institution. They must also have a verified GitHub account and provide proof of their student status, such as a school-issued email address or transcript.

Overall, the Student Developer Pack is a valuable resource for students who want to develop their skills and build their portfolios, as it provides them with access to a range of tools and services that they may not otherwise have access to.
