# Zenodo

## Zenodo Fundamentals
Best research data and code-sharing practices are essential to promote transparency, collaboration, and reproducibility in scientific endeavours. Firstly, researchers should organize and document their data and code meticulously to ensure its comprehensibility and reusability by others. Implementing appropriate data and code licenses and clear usage terms fosters ethical and legal sharing. Choosing reliable platforms, such as Zenodo and GitHub, facilitates long-term preservation and access.
[Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/) is an open-access, general-purpose repository designed to preserve and share diverse research outputs effectively. Its primary role is to ensure long-term accessibility and citation of research data, software code, and publications, fostering open science practices. Researchers can deposit their work in Zenodo, which assigns each upload a Digital Object Identifier [DOI](https://apastyle.apa.org/learn/faqs/what-is-doi), making it easily citable in scholarly publications. This DOI is a stable link to the preserved version, safeguarding research outputs from data loss or unavailability. By providing a secure and publicly accessible platform, Zenodo promotes collaboration, reproducibility, and the dissemination of scientific knowledge across various disciplines, benefiting both researchers and the wider global community.

## Integrating GitHub with Zenodo
This integration enhances collaboration and reproducibility within the scientific community. As developers continue to update their code on GitHub, Zenodo creates a record of each release, capturing the state of the project at that moment. This enables others to access and cite specific versions of the code, promoting transparent and reproducible research. By combining the collaborative capabilities of GitHub with the preservation and citation features of Zenodo, the integration facilitates the seamless sharing and documentation of research software, fostering open-source development and accelerating scientific progress.
## Examples of successful use cases for Zenodo and GitHub in research
* [Gene Ontology Data Archive](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405676622000166?via%3Dihub)
* [A large-scale COVID-19 Twitter chatter dataset for open scientific research - an international collaboration](https://zenodo.org/record/7834392)

## Let's get started with preserving your GitHub repository!
* Flip the switch: Choose the repository you wish to preserve and enable automatic preservation by toggling the switch. This activates Zenodo's feature to preserve your software automatically.
* Create a release: Head to GitHub and create a release for your repository. Zenodo will then automatically download a .zip-ball of each new release and generate a DOI (Digital Object Identifier) for it.
* Get the badge: Once your first release is complete, a DOI badge will appear next to your repository. You can include this badge in your GitHub README to showcase the DOI and highlight the preserved version of your software.
