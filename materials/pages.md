# Github Pages

## Connect a GitHub repository to a GitHub Pages website:

1. Create a new repository on GitHub with the name "username.github.io" (replace "username" with your GitHub username).
2. Upload your website files to the repository.
3. Ensure that you have an "index.html" file in the root directory of your repository. This file will be the main page of your website.
4. Once you have your repository set up, go to your repository's settings page.
5. Scroll down to the "GitHub Pages" section and select "master branch" or "main branch" as your source.
6. Click "Save" and wait for a few minutes for GitHub to build your website.
7. After the build process is complete, you will see a green message saying "Your site is published at https://username.github.io".
8. Click on the link to view your website.

## Connect three different GitHub repositories to a single GitHub Pages website:

1. Create a new repository on GitHub with the name "username.github.io" (replace "username" with your GitHub username).
2. Clone the repository to your local machine using Git.
3. Create a new folder for each of your three repositories inside the cloned repository folder. For example, you can name the folders "repo1", "repo2", and "repo3".
4. Clone each of the three repositories into their respective folders on your local machine.
5. Copy the contents of the "index.html" file from each of the three repositories into the root directory of the cloned repository folder.
6. Copy any other files (CSS, JavaScript, images, etc.) that your website needs from each of the three repositories into the root directory of the cloned repository folder.
7. Push the changes to the "username.github.io" repository on GitHub.
8. Go to your repository's settings page on GitHub.
9. Scroll down to the "GitHub Pages" section and select "master branch" or "main branch" as your source.
10. Click "Save" and wait for a few minutes for GitHub to build your website.
11. After the build process is complete, you will see a green message saying "Your site is published at https://username.github.io".
