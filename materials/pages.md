# Github Pages

## To link a GitHub repository to a GitHub Pages website, follow these steps:

1. Create a new repository on GitHub with the name "username.github.io" (replace "username" with your GitHub username).
2. Upload your website files to the repository.
3. Ensure that you have an "index.html" file in the root directory of your repository. This file will be the main page of your website.
4. Once you have your repository set up, go to your repository's settings page.
5. Scroll down to the "GitHub Pages" section and select "master branch" or "main branch" as your source.
6. Click "Save" and wait for a few minutes for GitHub to build your website.
7. After the build process is complete, you will see a green message saying "Your site is published at https://username.github.io".
8. Click on the link to view your website.
