# Github Projects
GitHub is a web-based platform that is widely used for version control and collaborative software development. GitHub projects refer to the various software projects that are hosted on the platform.

When a project is hosted on GitHub, developers can create and manage the project's code, track its changes over time, and collaborate with other developers on the project. Each project has its own repository, which is a central location where all the project's files and code are stored.

One of the key features of GitHub is its ability to track changes made to a project over time. This is done through the use of Git, a distributed version control system. Git allows developers to create branches of the code, make changes, and merge those changes back into the main branch when they are ready.

GitHub projects also include a range of other features that help with collaboration and project management. For example, developers can use issues to track bugs or feature requests, create pull requests to propose changes to the code, and use project boards to manage their work and keep track of what needs to be done.

In addition to its features for software development, GitHub also has a strong community of users who contribute to open source projects. This makes it a valuable resource for developers who are looking to share their work, collaborate with others, and learn from others in the field.
